Todo app implemented using JavaScript

In this Project I'm creating Todo App with HTML,CSS and Basic javaScript.

About The Project :

1. In this we can enter and todo list element in input field and we can enter the field and we can see that element ,down the input field.
2. We can also see the elements in the lists container below the input field.
3. After entering the element in input field , we can click tick mark when we completed the task.
4. After clicking the tick mark it will animated to half opacity and also the text will be transformed into line through.
5. And also we can delete the todo list after completing the task and also it will bel deletd in the lists container.
6. In this I'm using basic javascript to delete element and do some animations with Css after deleting the element.
